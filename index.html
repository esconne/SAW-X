                <h1>Welcome to SAW X</h1>
                <p>
                    Set between the events of SAW I and II, a sick and desperate John travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer â€“ only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable. <br><br>
                    The film has a lot of psychological torture rather than physical torture. A man is forced to saw off his own foot, a woman is forced to dig through the stomach of a man for a key, and a man has his head smashed with a toilet tank. <br><br>
                    The film sees John Kramer (Bell) travelling to Mexico in hopes that an experimental procedure may cure his terminal cancer. John later discovers that the operation is a scam, prompting him to kidnap those responsible and subject them to his trademark death traps as retribution. <br><br>
                    Please, if you are afraid of blood, do not watch this film. This is too bloody and violent a film for adults only. We've warned you. Beware!

                <h1>Eye Vacuum Trap</h1>
                <p>
                    The Eye Vacuum Trap is a trap from the Saw franchise, appearing in Saw X as a figment of John Kramer's imagination, one that he envisions to its conclusion while observing a custodian on the verge of stealing from an unconscious patient.
                    <br><br>
                    When the game begins, the generator in the vacuum cleaner starts running and slightly increases in power with each click of the dial. However, after 60 seconds, the vacuum quickly accelerates to a high enough speed to extract the subject's eyeballs.
                    <br><br>
                    To stop the machine, the subject would have to turn the dial across all five settings to break or dislocate each finger, stop the vacuum, and free themselves.

                     <p>
                        After waking up, the Custodian manages to turn the dial once, struggles on the second turn, and stops at the third, the vacuum stops only for a moment before sucking out his left then his right eye. The custodian is left screaming afterwards as the trap did not kill him, but only left him blind, however that would be so if the trap actually occurred.
                        <br><br>
                        In reality, John was taking a drink of water from a fountain outside of the room when he noticed that the custodian in the room nearby was handling a patient's possessions, after observing the medical device on the Patient's hand which happened to be holding his fingers in place. John thought up this trap design as he was observing the custodian handle the patients watch, however the custodian took notice and decided not to go through with it and then leaving the room, prompting John to verbally approve of his decision.
